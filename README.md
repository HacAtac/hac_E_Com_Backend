<h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Dealing with a node application, npm packages, sequelize/mysql2, dotenv, express.js I've created a Object-Relational Mapping E-commerce Back End application that utilizes CRUD methods properly.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>First I formated the file structure.</li>
    <li>Then I've downloaded the required NPM packages and required them in files.</li>
    <li>Then i've used sequelize Database Models with js to create and format tables</li>
    <li>Utilizing Associations in the models/index.js file to create relations from tables we've used sequlize and JS to create JOINs</li>
    <li>Then i've used npm run seeds to seed the database.</li>
    <li>Then I've used dotenv package to store sensitive data with environment variables data securely with a .env file</li>
    <li>Then we've synced sequelize to the database on Server Start "server.js"</li>
    <li>Using the routes that we've created were able to use the express database server to utlizize CRUD methods</li>
    <li>This has been a fun and challenging project and i'm looking forward to the next! </li>
